                <h1>What is Universal Design?</h1>
                <p>Universal Design is the design/composition that anybody regardless of age, disability or any related factors can use it.</p>

                <h2>Norman's Design Principles </h2> <br>
                <h3> Affordance </h3>
                <p> Affordance is the idea that something matches the intended use. For example, a door knob is intended to be pulled and turned. </p> <br> 
                <h3> Constraint </h3>
                <p> The purpose of constraint is to prevent the user from misusing and causing error in an action. An example of this is when opening the door of a washing machine, the washer stops to prevent a mess being made.</p> <br> 
                <h3> Visibility</h3>
                <p> Visibility is tied with constraint as physical constraints being visible is most successful to prevent a wrong attempt even before trying it.</p> <br> 
                <h3> Mapping </h3>
                <p> Mapping is the idea that something within proximity of the operation is closely tied to it whether its due to the distance or position. A great example of this is the knobs on a stove which should be intuitive which belongs to which stove.</p> <br>

                <h2> <abbr title = "Accessible Rich Internet Applications"> ARIA </abbr></h2> <br> 
                <h3> Accessible Rich Internet Applications </h3>
                <!-- Using elements of super specific HTML markup -->
                <blockquote cite="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/what-heck-aria-beginners-guide-aria-accessibility">
                    <q>ARIA is a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements that define ways to make web content and applications accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies (AT)". Part of Universal Design includes ARIA which is something made for screen reader users and those who rely on keyboard.</q>
                    <cite> -Kat Shaw (lullabot) </cite>
                    </blockquote> <br>
                <h3> Support for ARIA </h3>
                <p> Not all technologies support ARIA but those that do include browsers, AT (screen readers, magnifiers, etc), applications and JavaSciprt toolkits. </p> <br> 
                <h3> The Main Components of ARIA </h3>
                <p> Roles are a component of ARIA which are used to define a UI element </p>
                <p> States and Properties are applied to elements and used to help ARIA roles. </p>
